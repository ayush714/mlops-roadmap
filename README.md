# Machine Learning Operations(MLOps) Roadmap ü§ñ

This repository is a comprehensive guide for anyone who wishes to learn MLOps. It contains a roadmap with various topics and resources. You can find detailed videos on these topics on my YouTube channel (linked in the description). For a more in-depth understanding, consider enrolling in my comprehensive course.

## Table of Contents

I will divide the resources into different levels of learning and will also provide the best resources to learn each topic. The levels of learning are:

- **Machine Learning and Data Science Basics
- **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- **DevOps
- **MLOps
- **My Courses

## Machine Learning and Data Science Basics <a name="ml-ds-basics"></a>

Before you start your journey, it's essential to have a solid base in machine learning and data science. Please refer to my Machine Learning Roadmap Video for a structured approach to these subjects.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) <a name="sdlc"></a>

Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle is the next step:

- Requirement Gathering Analysis: Understand what the client needs and determine the feasibility of the requirements.
- Design: Plan and design the software-based on the requirement analysis.
- Implementation or Coding: Build the software by integrating the pieces of code and libraries.
- Testing: Test the software for any bugs and ensure it works as expected.
- Deployment: Release the software on live servers where actual users will use it.
- Maintenance: After deployment, introduce updates and improvements to the software.

You can find the detailed resources related to SDLC in this [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/rajeevranjancom/SDLC) 

## DevOps <a name="devops"></a>

Next, learn about DevOps. The important topics include:

- Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
- Version Control Systems (like Git)

## MLOps <a name="mlops"></a>

Once you have a good grasp of DevOps, it's time to dive into MLOps:

- Data Versioning: Tools like [DVC (Data Version Control)](https://dvc.org/)
- Model Versioning: Tools like [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) and DVC
- Model Packaging: Tools like Docker
- Model Validation and Testing: Tools like [TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) and [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/)
- Continuous Integration for Machine Learning: Tools like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Continuous Deployment for Machine Learning: Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps
- Model Monitoring and Retraining: Tools like ModelDB, MLflow, and TFX
- Governance and Regulatory Compliance: Tools like IBM OpenPages and Collibra
